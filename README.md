## Simple cipher encryption and decryption tool using the Caesar cipher.

This code defines two functions: 'encrypt' and 'decrypt', which perform the encryption and decryption operations using the Caesar cipher. The 'encrypt' function takes a plain text and a shift value as input and returns the encrypted text. The 'decrypt' function takes a cipher text and a shift value as input and returns the decrypted text.

You can run this code in Python and provide a text to encrypt/decrypt along with a shift value. The program will output the encrypted and decrypted texts based on the provided shift value.
